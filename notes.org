* THINGS TO DO
** TODO do some type checking for the input yaml
like, make sure that it goes like

services:
  myservice

and not 

services:
  - myservice

or else, support both
** TODO friendly interface
 - [ ] handle args / remind about args

** DONE ALWAYS down docker-compose

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2020-04-10 Fri 12:45]
** TODO ping servers until ready to start
in order to not test servers that aren't ready, i have a 3s wait. this
would be way cooler if it round robin pinged the servers until they
are confirmed up and ready.

** TODO playground mode
bring servers up. do not run tests. let user do what they want. (don't
-d docker containers)

** TODO template my apps
Templite+
